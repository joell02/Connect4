# Connect4
I independently programmed a connect four game similar to the original game but with a few tweaks. The game has a computer mode, where you can play a bot with two modes: easy or hard. Easy mode is just the computer placing randomized chips while hard mode has an algorithm that works to prevent the player from winning but is not flawless to give an opportunity for the player to win. Furthermore there is a new feature called the power chip which if placed erases all the chips in a column. There is also a multiplayer version in which you can play friends.
